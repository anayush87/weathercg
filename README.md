# Weather Dashboard - Color \& Lighting Models

A visually engaging weather dashboard built with Python and Tkinter, demonstrating the use of color and lighting models for different weather conditions. The dashboard displays current weather information, a 5-day forecast, and interactive features such as theme switching and simulated data refresh.

---

## Features

- **Current Weather:**
Displays temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and location.
- **5-Day Forecast:**
Shows daily weather icons and temperature predictions.
- **Color \& Lighting Models:**
Demonstrates how different weather conditions can be represented with distinct color schemes.
- **Interactive Controls:**
    - Refresh weather data (simulated)
    - Change the application theme

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-dashboard-tkinter.git
cd weather-dashboard-tkinter
```

2. **Install Python (if not already installed):**
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. **No external dependencies required!**
Tkinter is included with standard Python installations.

---

## Usage

Run the application with:

```bash
python weather_dashboard.py
```

or, if you named your file differently:

```bash
python <your_script_name>.py
```

The dashboard window will appear, showing the weather interface.

---

## How It Works

- **Simulated Data:**
Weather data is randomly generated for demonstration purposes. Click "Refresh Data" to simulate new weather conditions.
- **Color Models:**
The main weather card and details change color based on the weather condition (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, etc.).
- **Theme Switching:**
Click "Change Theme" to cycle through different background themes.

## Limitations

- The dashboard currently uses simulated weather data.
*To use real weather data, integrate with an API such as OpenWeatherMap.*
- Not intended for use in cloud-based notebooks (e.g., Google Colab, Kaggle) as Tkinter GUIs require a local desktop environment.
